# TODO

* add docstrings
* create more sample inputs to show off pathfinding
* refactor everything after cloning the map
* maybe change coords class to cell class with coords and value, change map accordingly
* maybe identify coords by integer, like width*y+x
* getAt, setAt neccessary, especially in the map class itself?
* maybe add -v flag with colorized map with coord axes, as well as path output after each step
