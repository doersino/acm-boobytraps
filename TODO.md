# TODO

## `boobytraps.py`
* clean up
* no optimizations: costs are all 1, so simplify graph structure => adj list?
* add comments
* improve efficiency by using list or object instead of dict for queue frames
* return and prettyprint (with red background) the "best effort" (longest attempt, or one that got closest to end) if no path is found, which is easy because it's the last element of the queue
* rework main function

* maybe experiment with using a faster language?

## `gravedigger.sh`
* permit start/end coordinates > 199 if within bounds of map

## `tombraider.sh`

## `sampleinput5.txt`
* maybe luke starting somewhere near the bottom right, separated by death ray
