# TODO

## `boobytraps.py`
* when pretty-printing, also display visited cells (for each trap?)
* no optimizations: costs are all 1, so simplify graph structure => adj list?
* improve efficiency by using list or object instead of dict for queue frames
* add comments
* clean up

* maybe experiment with using a faster language?

## `sampleinput5.txt`
* Add deadends etc.
