# TODO

## `boobytraps.py`
* maybe try propagating visited to lower traps in speedup structure to increase performance further
* return and prettyprint (with red background) the "best effort" (longest attempt, or one that got closest to end) if no path is found, which is easy because it's the last element of the queue
* rework main function
* no optimizations: costs are all 1, so simplify graph structure => adj list?
* improve efficiency by using list or object instead of dict for queue frames
* add comments
* clean up

* maybe experiment with using a faster language?

## `sampleinput5.txt`
* Add deadends etc.
