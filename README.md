# acm-boobytraps

My Python 2.x solution of the ACM Programming Contest problem ["Booby Traps"](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=258&page=show_problem&problem=1649), created as part of my assignment for the ["Selected Fun Problems of the ACM Programming Contest" proseminar](http://db.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/SelectedFunProblemsoftheACMProgrammingContest-Proseminar-WS2015-2016.html) at Uni TÃ¼bingen during the 2015 fall semester.

## Table of Contents
Books have one, so why shouldn't software?

* `boobytraps.py` contains the code solving the problem.
* `gravedigger.py` is a simple map generator I wrote for testing the performance of `boobytraps.py` on large maps.
* `sampleinput.txt` contains the sample input with which to test the solution.
* `sampleoutput.txt` contains the sample output with which to test the solution.
* `screenshot.png` shows the code in action.
* `tombraider.sh` is a short shell script for efficiently testing the solution.

## Example Usage

Test the shortest path finder on the sample input and output given with the problem statement:
```
./tombraider.sh -i sampleinput.txt -o sampleoutput.txt
```

Randomly generate a 15x15 map and find the shortest path from start to end:
```
python gravedigger.py 15 15 | python boobytraps.py
```
